## ðŸ–– First things first

Ruby is a versatile **general-purpose** language that can be used across various domains, from web development to IoT. 

However, it has gained significant adoption in the web development industry, particularly in the startup scene since the mid-2000s.

It can be [downloaded](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) in several ways, including using a Docker image for those who prefer using Docker.

---

## ðŸ’Ž How is Ruby implemented
If you downloaded Ruby from the official website or used the default Docker image, you likely have the standard Ruby implementation: **CRuby**, which is primarily written in C.

Although there are several implementations of Ruby, such as _JRuby and Rubinius_, **CRuby** is the most commonly used among major companies such as Shopify and Github.

## âŒ› A time travel to the Ruby's history

Ruby was created in the early 1990s by Yukiriro Matsumoto, or "Matz", a programmer and computer scientist in Japan. 

### ðŸŸ¢ 1993, where it all started
Matz started the Ruby implementation in 1993, drawing inspiration from existing languages like Perl and Smalltalk. His implementation was called **CRuby**, or "MRI" (Matz Ruby Interpreter).

ðŸ‘‰ **Ruby is interpreted**
CRuby is an **interpreter**, meaning that the source code is not compiled into optimized code; instead, it is interpreted line-by-line and translated to low-level instructions during execution.


![CRuby before YARV](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ktz4dps84fxrw7ld6osx.png)

### ðŸŸ¢ 1995-2000, big in Japan
Ruby was first released publicly in 1995, and until 1999, several features and improvements were added to the standard library. However, its adoption remained limited to Japan.

In 2000, Dave Thomas and Andy Hunt published the first English-book on Ruby, "Programming Ruby" (a.k.a The _Pickaxe Book_), which played a crucial role in popularizing Ruby outside of Japan.

### ðŸŸ¢ 2004, Ruby on Rails
**Ruby on Rails**, a web application framework built with Ruby, was released by David Heinemeier Hansson (a.k.a DHH). This framework played a significant role in Ruby's widespread adoption in the web development community.

### ðŸŸ¢ 2007, meet YARV
CRuby was known to have various performance problems due to its interpretation process, lacking a compilation process such as **JIT** (Just-in-time compilation).

During the development of version 1.9, the Ruby core team decided to refactor a significant portion of the CRuby source code. This resulted in the creation of the Ruby VM, which was integrated into the CRuby interpreter.

The new VM, called **YARV** (Yet Another Ruby VM, duhh :P), takes the parsed tree (AST) and generates a bytecode instead of low-level instructions, enabling optimizations to be made. This bytecode is then translated into optimized low-level instructions, resulting in improved performance.


![YARV](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6qzkhbhh607fkrhruxks.png)

Later, in the version 2.6, a new JIT was introduced, called **MJIT**. This uses a separate thread to perform optimizations on a portion of Ruby code, which are then joined during the execution process.

![YARV + MJIT](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ro54m3maxvc5cjry8q7a.png)

### ðŸŸ¢ 2021, the Ruby 3.0
After years of continuous improvement, **Ruby 3.0** was realeased in 2021, introducing new features to address the lack of _concurrency, parallelism, and async I/O_.

**Ractors** were introduced to enable parallelism on CPU, while **Fibers** brought a new scheduler interface that enables cooperative scheduling. When used with non-blocking I/O, this allows for faster Ruby applications that are heavily I/O bound.

### ðŸŸ¢ YJIT, a new hope
The Ruby core team is currently developing a new version of Ruby that includes a faster JIT compiler called **YJIT**. This new JIT is expected to be faster than the current MJIT, providing significant performance improvements for Ruby applications.

## ðŸ’Ž Ruby key features
Ruby is a high-level programming language that uses an interpreter to translate Ruby code into low-level code.

Some of the key features of Ruby include:

ðŸ‘‰ **Dynamic types**
Ruby is a dynamically typed language, which means that variable types are determined at runtime.

ðŸ‘‰ **Object oriented**
Not only Ruby supports OOP, everything in Ruby is an object, including primitive data types like numbers and strings. By using dynamic dispatch, Ruby combines data and behaviour for almost everything in a Ruby program.

ðŸ‘‰ **Mixins**
Ruby uses mixins instead of multiple inheritance, which allows for modular and reusable code. Mixins are achieved through the use of modules, which can be included in classes to provide additional functionality.

ðŸ‘‰ **Garbage collected**
Ruby brings automatic memory management, taking care of allocating and freeing memory of objects as needed. This process is called Garbage Collection, or GC.

ðŸ‘‰ **Metaprogramming**
Ruby allows for metaprogramming, which means that you can write code that generates or modifies other code at runtime. This feature enables expressive and flexible programming techniques like domain-specific languages (DSLs).

ðŸ‘‰ **Functional programming**
Although Ruby is not a purely functional language, it supports functional programming concepts like high-order functions and immutable data structures. It also includes functional constructs like blocks, procs and lambdas, which enable the creation of expressive and concise code. 

---

## ðŸ’Ž Hello, world
Every programming language deserves a "Hello, world" example, and Ruby is no exception. Here's the simplest "Hello, world" program you can write in Ruby:

```bash
$ ruby -e 'print "Hello, world\n"'
Hello, world
```
* `ruby` is the CRuby interpreter that takes an input in the form of Ruby source code
* the `-e` option allows Ruby code to be passed directly to the command line instead of from a source file
* `print` is a *method* in Ruby that outputs arbitrary text to STDOUT
* the message is finished with a `\n` character, which ensures the output is properly formatted and doesn't overlap the next line in the shell

Alternatively, Ruby provides a method called `puts` that automatically appends a `\n` character to the given text:
```bash
$ ruby -e 'puts "Hello, world"'
Hello, world
```

---

## ðŸ’Ž IRB
Ruby's interactive shell, known as IRB (Interactive Ruby), provides a convenient way to experiment with Ruby code and test small code snippets without needing to write and execute a full program.

```bash
$ irb
irb(main):001:0>
```
Now, in IRB:
```ruby
1 + 1
=> 2
```

---

## ðŸ’Ž Data Types
Ruby includes data types commonly used in mainstream technologies:
```ruby
+------------+------------------------------+
| Data Type  | Examples                     |
+------------+------------------------------+
| Integer    | 42, -10, 0                   |
| Float      | 3.14, -1.23e-4               |
| Boolean    | true, false                  |
| String     | "Hello, world!", 'Ruby'      |
| Array      | [1, 2, 3],                   |
|            | ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']|
| Hash       | {name: 'Alice', age: 25}     |
| Symbol     | :name, :age, :status         |
| Nil        | nil                          |
+------------+------------------------------+
```

ðŸ‘‰ **Ruby is dynamically typed**
As mentioned earlier, Ruby is a dynamically-typed language, meaning that variable types are determined at runtime.

```ruby
name = "Leandro"
age = 18
```
It's worth noting that Ruby doesn't require variable type specifications. 

Instead, the interpreter dynamically infers the value's data type at runtime, allowing programs to execute successfully without explicit type declarations.

We can confirm this behavior by calling the `class` method on variables:
```ruby
name.class
=> String

age.class
=> Integer
```
But how it's possible to call methods from primitive data types in Ruby?

---

## ðŸ’Ž Everything in Ruby is an object
Since _everything in Ruby is an object_, even primitive data types such as strings and integers can have instance methods called on them. 

This makes Ruby a highly object-oriented language, where every piece of data is represented as an object with its own state and behavior.
```ruby
name.object_id
=> 80

age.object_id
=> 37

1.class
=> Integer

1.object_id
=> 3
```
Before we dive deeper into object-oriented programming in Ruby, it's important to understand **what an object is** and how it works in the context of the language.

### ðŸ”µ OOP
Alan Kay, one of the pioneers of object-oriented programming (OOP), defined an object as a **unit of software that encapsulates data and behavior**. 

This definition means that an object combines data (state) and the code that manipulates that data (behavior), resulting in a more modular and organized approach to programming.

### ðŸ”µ OOP in Ruby
To create objects in Ruby, we need to define a template that can generate multiple objects. In Ruby, this template is defined using the `class` keyword:

```ruby
class Account
end
```

Objects in Ruby, also called instances, can be created by calling the method `new` in the class:

```ruby
Account.new # an instance of the Account class
Account.new # another instance
Account.new # yet another instance
...
```

We can confirm that an instance object represents the `Account` class and holds an object ID by calling the instance methods `class` and `object_id`:
```ruby
account = Account.new

account.class
=> Account

account.object_id
=> 60
```

ðŸ‘‰ **Classes are objects too**
Remember, everything in Ruby is an object. Classes are no different. 

Classes are just instances created from the class `Class`:

```ruby
Account.class
=> Class

Account.object_id
=> 80
```

![classes are objects](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/73xehqnir7x719rex9fx.png)

ðŸ‘‰ **Also, Integers are objects**
We can represent the integers as instances from the `Integer` class, since Integer is an instance of the `Class` class:

![Integers are objects](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6y5lhspzf7bc7m27zdm4.png)

ðŸ‘‰ **Single inheritance**

Ruby uses single inheritance, which means that every class inherits from a single superclass. It's worth noting that every class in Ruby will inherit from the [BasicObject](https://ruby-doc.org/core-3.0.0/BasicObject.html) parent class in some way. 

We can verify this behavior in Ruby by examining class hierarchies:

```ruby
Account.new.class     # Account
Account.class         # Class
Account.superclass    # Object

1.class               # Integer
Integer.class         # Class
Integer.superclass    # Numeric
Numeric.superclass    # Object

Class.superclass      # Module
Module.superclass     # Object

Object.superclass      # BasicObject
BasicObject.superclass # nil
```
Based on the example above, here's a portion of the Ruby class hierarchy:

![class hierarchy](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lpid3tiwlidnyprpakd4.png)

### ðŸ”µ Modeling OOP in Ruby
In Ruby, everything is an object, which means that instances can hold state (attributes) and behavior (methods).

In our current implementation, the `Account` class has no visible state or behavior, as it inherits all of its attributes and methods from the Object class. However, let's say we want every `Account` instance to have a starting balance of zero.

Let's see the solution.

ðŸ‘‰ **The initialize method**
Ruby provides a special method called `initialize`, which is automatically called every time a new instance is created (i.e., when `Account.new` is called). 

By default, `initialize` is empty, so there's no need to define it. However, since we want to modify the initialization of the object, we should override the `initialize` method:

```ruby
class Account
  def initialize
    @amount = 0
  end
end

leandro = Account.new
john = Account.new
```
You might be wondering about the `@` character that appears before the variable name in our example. In Ruby, variables inside methods are typically treated as local variables by default:
```ruby
def some_method
  name = "Leandro"
end
```

It's important to note that local variables within methods are discarded by the interpreter when the method is finished.

To store variables that should persist during the lifetime of an object (i.e., its state), we should use **instance variables** instead. In Ruby, instance variables are denoted by the `@` symbol.

Here's a visual representation of instance variables:

![initialize with instance variable](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7ifnjzf67otm30w60pla.png)

ðŸ‘‰ **Objects in Ruby are encapsulated**
In Ruby, an instance's state is **private by default**, which means that we cannot directly access an object's state from outside the object. Instead, we can use instance methods to retrieve or modify the object's state.

To demonstrate this, we can create an instance method called `balance`, which will return the current balance of the account object:
```ruby
class Account
  def initialize
    @balance = 0
  end

  def balance
    @balance 
  end
end
```
With the `balance` method defined, we can now retrieve the current balance of our account instance:
```ruby
leandro = Account.new

leandro.balance 
=> 0
```
It's true that state without manipulation is often useless. To make our `Account` class more practical, we can define another **instance method** that will modify the balance:

```ruby
class Account
  def initialize
    @balance = 0
  end

  def balance
    @balance
  end

  def set_balance(balance)
    @balance = balance
  end
end

leandro = Account.new
leandro.set_balance(10)

leandro.balance
=> 10
```

In the `set_balance` method, it's important to understand the difference between `balance` and `@balance`:

* `balance` is a local variable that exists only during the lifetime of the method execution.
* `@balance` is an instance variable that persists during the lifetime of the instance object.

ðŸ‘‰ **Syntactic sugar all the way**
Now, suppose we want to modify the balance using a setter method. In Ruby, we can define setter methods by appending an `=` sign to the method name, like so: `balance=(balance)`:
```ruby
class Account
  ...
  def balance
    @balance 
  end

  def balance=(balance)
    @balance = balance
  end
end

leandro = Account.new
leandro.balance=(10)

leandro.balance
=> 10
```
Ruby is a language that values simplicity and readability, and it makes use of syntactic sugar to achieve this. One example of this is the ability to **omit parentheses when calling methods**:
```ruby
leandro.balance=(10) 

# becomes

leandro.balance= 10
```
In fact, Ruby goes even further in its quest for readability and simplicity. When calling a method with a suffix of `=`, we can omit the parentheses and instead add a **blank space before** the `=` sign:
```ruby
leandro.balance= 10

# becomes

leandro.balance = 10
```
Pretty cool, isn't it? With this syntax, we can make method calls that look like variable assignments!
```ruby
class Account
  def initialize
    @balance = 0
  end

  def balance
    @balance
  end

  def balance=(balance)
    @balance = balance
  end
end
```

ðŸ‘‰ **attr_reader/writer/accessor**
One of the great things about Ruby is that it provides built-in class methods like `attr_reader` that can help make our code more concise and readable. 

In particular, `attr_reader` works like a getter method for **instance variables**, allowing us to access their values from outside the class:

```ruby
def balance
  @balance  
end

# becomes

attr_reader :balance
```
In addition to `attr_reader`, Ruby also provides `attr_writer`, which works like a setter method for instance variables:

```ruby
def balance=(balance)
  @balance 
end

# becomes

attr_writer :balance
```
Together, these two methods can help make our code more concise and easier to read, enabling us to quickly define and manipulate instance variables with ease:
```ruby
class Account
  attr_reader :balance
  attr_writer :balance
  
  def initialize
    @balance = 0
  end
end
```
To further simplify the code, we can use `attr_accessor` when we have both a `attr_reader` and `attr_writer` method for the same instance variable:
```ruby
class Account
  attr_accessor :balance
  
  def initialize
    @balance = 0
  end
end

leandro = Account.new
leandro.balance = 10

leandro.balance
=> 10
```
Ruby truly does make programming a joy!
